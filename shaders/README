Use glslangValidator to generate SPIR-V binaries from GLSL code.  Command goes
something like this:

    $ ../path/to/glslangValidator -V src.frag

Will generate a binary called:

    frag.spv

that you will have to rename to suit your needs.  A script can be built to make
that process easier, but I'm not there yet.
